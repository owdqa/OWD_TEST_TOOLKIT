# These 'types' and ids need to match the Jira User Story id's
# (the ones that contain a list of 'is tested by' test cases).
#
# Because of the way in which test cases are set up in Jira,
# the new branch includes all the tests of the old branch.
#
# Therefore sometimes there will sometimes be more than one
# jira test id in here (for example 1.1 includes: 1.0.1 and 1.1).
